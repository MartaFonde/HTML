        <h3>The why of things</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h1>Why do the glasses allow us to see better?</h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>The glasses are an invention of 1286. But they have been carving lenses from <br> practically the fifth century BC. The ancients knew that they allowed us to see enlarged <br> or better focused objects, but not exactly why.</h2>
    </p>

    <p>
        Light is a set of electromagnetic waves that move around straight
        <it>ray</it> lines. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the lens of the eye, those rays that come from an object change their direction, <b>to arrive coordinately at the retina</b>, where they <br> generate electrical currents that the brain interprets as images of objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        In many people, <u>the lens does not get electrical currents generated in a small number of retina cells, and the image is <b>thick, blurred.</b></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        The glasses of the glasses <i><b>change</b></i> the speed of the light and, with it, the directions of the rays that reach the lens, <u>so that the images of<br>
        new rays that come out of it now are clear.</u>
